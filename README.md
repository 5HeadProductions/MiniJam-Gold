# MiniJam-Gold

We joined the Mini Jam 85 and decided to make out game where the player, a gold coin has fallen inside a piggy bank and now has to climb out of the pig and escape. 

Despite its straight foward task Escape The Pig's movement mechanics combined with additional coins falling makes escaping the pig challenging!


Game Jam Task:
Mini jam is a 72-hour-long video game development jam that occurs every two weeks on Itch.io.
A required limitation is announced as soon as the jam starts to spice things up. Remember, limitation breeds creativity. You get the theme early, so you can plan ahead, Just keep in mind that you may have to change your idea when the limitation is revealed. This jam's theme is GOLD.  Remember, theme is purely inspirational and not required. Feel free to interpret it however you want.
The limitation is: One-Minute Timer

There's a lot of creative flexibility here. With this limitation, you'll have to implement a timer of exactly 60 seconds into your game. Your game must be functionally tied to this timer. What happens when the timer reaches 0? Should something happen every second? Should the timer pause? Can you add time back to the timer? That's all for you to decide.
